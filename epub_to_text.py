    - Replaces internal whitespace with underscores to make filenames shell-friendly

def extract_chapter_text(content_item):
    """
    Extracts plain text from an EPUB content item using BeautifulSoup.

    Explanation:
    - content_item is an object representing a single file from inside the EPUB archive,
      such as a chapter's HTML content.
    - The `get_content()` method returns the raw HTML byte content of that file.
    - BeautifulSoup parses the HTML so we can extract plain text.

    Args:
        content_item (epub.EpubHtml): HTML content object from the EPUB book

    Returns:
        str: Extracted plain text from the HTML

    Steps:

        - Get the title and href (internal path to content)
